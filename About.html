            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Jojo's Cuts, in Johannesburg, is Jonathan 'Jojo' Joestar's spot for good
                haircuts that don't break the bank. He built it himself, trying to
                make a salon that stands out from the rest. They do everything: buzz cuts,
                fades, braids, you name it. Basically, if you need your hair done,
                they've got you covered, and they keep the prices down.It's become
                a go-to place for people who want a solid haircut without the fancy salon
                prices.
            </p>
